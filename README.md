# Match-Up! Memory Challenge

## Description

Match-Up is a memory game where users try to match card numbers, ranging from 1 to 9, together.

This application was built from scratch (i.e. no "Create React App") to gain a better understanding of how a React application works under the hood. I developed the Webpack configuration file, which gave more insight into all the different features Webpack has to offer and why they are used. Overall, I was able to gain more knowledge about React, Webpack, and Babel, and can add them to my skillset.

- Webpack
